Send push messages from your home devices, applications, monitoring systems or anywhere else to your mobile Ride app

Ride (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nedeos.ride) is a mobile app, capable to receive messages, which have been pushed from your home devices, servers, applications, monitoring systems or any other device.

The provided code samples are based on PHP and allow you to send messages to your mobile device, which has Ride installed. Messages can be sent to individuals, to members of groups, and as broadcasts to a speficic regions.

Messages may include just text, text and individual icons, or text, icons and additional images. Depending on the provided content the Ride app will present the received message as text or text with image. Included links can be used to forward the user to other applications or sites.

The samples also include code to send messages with geo-location triggers. Users with Ride installed receive your messages once they enter specific areas. 

A broadcast sample shows how to send local broadcast messages (The latter two solutions require special activation - contact me at info@siehog.com).
