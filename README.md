Send push messages from your home devices or anywhere else to your mobile Ride app

Ride (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nedeos.ride) is a mobile background app, waiting to send notifications, which have been pushed from your devices or anywhere else. The provided examples are based on PHP and allow you to send messages directly to your mobile device, to send geofencing messages with enabled triggers for Ride, or local broadcast messages (The latter ones require special activation).
